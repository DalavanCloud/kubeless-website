# Kubernetes-native serverless

**Kubeless** is a framework that lets you deploy small bits of code without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure plumbing. It leverages Kubernetes resources to provide auto-scaling, API routing, monitoring, troubleshooting and more.

To introduce you to Kubeless, we have created several guides and examples for you. Start by setting up Kubeless following the [quick start guide](./docs/quick-start).
